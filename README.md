##Introduction

[Back to Table of Contents](README.md#table-of-contents)

<!-- 
* Intro complemented by slides in [llea.halfwheeler.com/deck](https://docs.google.com/deck here)

* Framework for scalable, distributed processing of sensory data that aims at low latency

* Partial sensory data is interpreted before complete, knowing that final measurements arrive at processing unit delayed (event time vs. processing time). Delay is Gaussian distributed

* Redis key/value storage for maintaining and updating state (alternative would be Spark stateful streaming. network shuffle during stateful streaming).
